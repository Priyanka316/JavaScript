    <h3>1. Introduction to Javascript</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Javascript is interpreted language(line by line execution).</li>
        <li>Transfer one langauge into another language.</li>
        <li>It is compiled language.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.How Javascript works and Execution context</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Everything in Javascript happens inside execution context.For every line new execution context is created.</li>
        <li>It consisting memory and code block, together we called as container. Memory stores variable and code contains execution part.Memory called as variable environment and Code is called as thread of execution. Before execution memory stores the variable as undefined and once it get executed it shows variable values.In code before execution it is empty once code gets executed code store the each executing lines.
        </li>
        <li>Topics on single threaded and multi threaded,Synchronous and Asynchronous.</li>
        <li>Javascript is known as front-end execution context : Variable and Fnction</li>
        <li>DRY -Don't repeat yourself</li>
        <li>Function is piece of code and used to perform the task.
        </li>
    </ul>

        - decalaration (3 types)
            - var
            - let
            - const 
        - hoisting in js
    </pre>
    <h2>Data types</h2>
    <pre>
        int --> 1, 2, 4, float 12.5

        string --> "MyName"   

        booleans: true and false 

        objects    

        array --> [1, 2, 4, 3, 6, 8]  (arrays are also objects)

        buffer --> learn while Node.js is being taught
    </pre>
    note : everything in javascript is getting converted into objects
    <pre>
        1. DECELARATIONS  
            3 types: let, const and var    

        1. var --> variable
        var a=12; //global scope
        console.log(a); /* in react js var will be a problem */

        2. const --> constant
        const w=12;
        console.log(w);

        3. var vs let 
        let --> block{ghar, house} defined
        let c=12; //block{ghar or house} scope
        console.log(c);

        {
            var a=34;
            console.log(a);
        }

        note : mostly 3 errors we can get
        syntax error , referrance error, type error
    </pre>
    <h2>Hoisting in JS</h2>
    <p><b> Hoisting is a default feature in JS than automatically pushes the function deleclaration at top so that it gets excuted before invocation</b></p>
    <pre>
        trex();
        console.log(q);
        var q=21;
        function trex() {
            console.log("Hello shinLord");
        }    
        trex();
    </pre>
    note : hoisting is not possible in let and const.
