    <h3>1. What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h3>
    <p>A temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the computer completely initializes it with a value.</p>

    <h3>2. What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax</h3>
    <p>The for loop repeats a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. It is typically used to execute a block of code for certain number of times. 
        <span>Its syntax is:</span> 
        <pre>for(initialization; condition; increment) { // Code to be executed.
        </pre>
        </p>

    <h3>3. Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript</h3>
    <span>Local or Function Scope:</span>
    <ul type="">
        <li>Variables that are declared inside a function or a method have Local or Function Scope.
        </li>
        <li>It means those variables or functions which are declared inside the function or a method can be accessed within that function only.</li>
    </ul>
    <span>Example:</span>
    <pre><script>
        function main_function() {
      
            // Variable with Local Scope...    
            var a = 2;
      
            // Nested Function having Function Scope    
            var multiply = function () {
                  
                // It can be accessed and altered as well
                console.log(a * 5);
            }
      
            // Will be called out when main_function gets called
            multiply();
        }
          
        // Display's the result...
        console.log(main_function());
      
        // Throws a reference error since it 
        // is a locally scoped variable
        console.log(a);
      
        // Throws a reference error since it 
        // is a locally scoped function
        multiplyBy2();
    </script></pre>    
    <span>Output:</span>
    <pre>10
        undefined
        Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined</pre>

    <span>Block Scope:</span>
    <ul>
        <li>Block Scope is related to the variables or functions which are declared using let and const since var does not have block scope.</li>
        <li>Block Scope tells us that variables that are declared inside a block { }, can be accessed within that block only, not outside of that block.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <span>Example:</span>
    <pre><script>
        {
            let x = 13;
        }
        // Throws a reference error 
        // since x is declared inside a block which 
        // cannot be used outside the block
        console.log(x);
    </script></pre>
    <span>Output:</span>
    <p>Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined</p>

    <span>Scope Chain:</span>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript engine uses scopes to find out the exact location or accessibility of variables and that particular process is known as Scope Chain.</li>
        <li>Scope Chain means that one variable has a scope (it may be global or local/function or block scope) is used by another variable or function having another scope (may be global or local/function or block scope).</li>
        <li>This complete chain formation goes on and stops when the user wishes to stop it according to the requirement.</li>
    </ul>
    <span>Example:</span>
    <pre><script>
        // Global variable
        var global_variable = 20;
      
        function main_function() {
            // Local Variable
            var local_variable = 30;
      
            var nested_function = function () {
      
                // Display the value inside the local variable
                console.log(local_variable);
            }
      
            var another_nested_function = function () {
                  
                // Displays the value inside the global variable
                console.log(global_variable);
            }
      
            nested_function();
            another_nested_function();
        }
      
        main_function();
    </script>
    </pre>
    <span>Output:
        30
        20
    </span>

    <h3>4. What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</h3>
    <p>Undefined:The undefined property indicates that the variable has not been assigned a value or not declared at all.</p>
    <p>Null: It's a value that we can initialized to a variable which will later be replaced with some other value.</p>

    <h3>5. what is Symbol?</h3>
    <p>Symbol is a primitive data type of JavaScript, along with string, number, boolean, null and undefined.</p>

    <h3>6. Write code to explain map and filter in arrays</h3>
    <p>Map: The map() method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function to each one of the elements of the first array.</p>
    <span>Example:</span>
    <pre>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        const doubled = numbers.map(item => item * 2);
        console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8]</pre>

    <p>The filter() method takes each element in an array and it applies a conditional statement against it. If this conditional returns true, the element gets pushed to the output array. If the condition returns false, the element does not get pushed to the output array.</p>
    <span>Example:1 </span>
    <pre>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        const evens = numbers.filter(item => item % 2 === 0);
        console.log(evens); // [2, 4]</pre>
    <span>Example:2</span>
    <p>In the next example, filter() is used to get all the students whose grades are greater than or equal to 90.
    </p>
    <pre>const students = [
        { name: 'Quincy', grade: 96 },
        { name: 'Jason', grade: 84 },
        { name: 'Alexis', grade: 100 },
        { name: 'Sam', grade: 65 },
        { name: 'Katie', grade: 90 }
      ];
      
      const studentGrades = students.filter(student => student.grade >= 90);
      return studentGrades; // [ { name: 'Quincy', grade: 96 }, { name: 'Alexis', grade: 100 }, { name: 'Katie', grade: 90 } ]</pre>

    <h3>7. Explain passed by value and passed by reference</h3>
    <p><b>Pass By Value:</b> In Pass by value, function is called by directly passing the value of the variable as an argument. So any changes made inside the function does not affect the original value.</p>
    <p>In Pass by value, parameters passed as an arguments create its own copy. So any changes made inside the function is made to the copied value not to the original value .</p>
    <span>Example: Passed By Value</span>
    <pre>function Passbyvalue(a, b) {
        let tmp;
        tmp = b;
        b = a;
        a = tmp;
        console.log(`Inside Pass by value 
            function -> a = ${a} b = ${b}`);
    }
      
    let a = 1;
    let b = 2;
    console.log(`Before calling Pass by value 
            Function -> a = ${a} b = ${b}`);
      
    Passbyvalue(a, b);
      
    console.log(`After calling Pass by value 
           Function -> a =${a} b = ${b}`);</pre>
    <pre>Before calling Pass by value Function -> a = 1 b = 2
    Inside Pass by value function -> a = 2 b = 1
    After calling Pass by value Function -> a =1 b = 2</pre>  

    <p><b>Pass by Reference:</b>In Pass by Reference, Function is called by directly passing the reference/address of the variable as an argument. So changing the value inside the function also change the original value. In JavaScript array and Object follows pass by reference property.</p>
    <p>In Pass by reference, parameters passed as an arguments does not create its own copy, it refers to the original value so changes made inside function affect the original value.</p>
    <span>Example: Passed By Reference</span>
    <pre>function PassbyReference(obj) {
        let tmp = obj.a;
        obj.a = obj.b;
        obj.b = tmp;
      
        console.log(`Inside Pass By Reference 
            Function -> a = ${obj.a} b = ${obj.b}`);
    }
      
    let obj = {
        a: 10,
        b: 20
      
    }
    console.log(`Before calling Pass By Reference 
        Function -> a = ${obj.a} b = ${obj.b}`);
      
    PassbyReference(obj)
      
    console.log(`After calling Pass By Reference 
        Function -> a = ${obj.a} b = ${obj.b}`);</pre>
    <pre>Before calling Pass By Reference Function -> a = 10 b = 20
    Inside Pass By Reference Function -> a = 20 b = 10
    After calling Pass By Reference Function -> a = 20 b = 10</pre>
    
    <h3>8. Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</h3>
    <p>A self-invoking expression is know as immidiately invoking function expression. It invoked (started) automatically, without being called. Function expressions will execute automatically if the expression is followed by (). You cannot self-invoke a function declaration.</p>
    <span>Example:</span>
    <pre>function(){
        //block of code
    })();
    IIFE function Expression
    </pre>

    <h3>9. What is an event loop and call stack</h3>
    <p>Main work of event loop is to check the call stack if it is empty or not.call stack works in First In Last Out.Call stack consist of that are not having waiting period</p>
    <p>waiting period in the place called call stack completely empty, event loop comes into action and check the waiting queue anything to execute.call stack where we are setting time and waiting queue(FIFO).It will bring out from the queue,bring inside call stack and starts executing.</p>
